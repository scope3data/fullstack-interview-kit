## ðŸŽ¯ Ticket: Implement Monthly Emissions Trend Analysis CLI Command

**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Medium
**Component:** Explore Dashboard
**Status:** Not Started

### ðŸ“‹ Description

We want to visualize our carbon footprint benchmark data for a variety of web properties and give our customers a way to explore and filter through that data.

### ðŸŽ¯ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **API Exploration & Single Property Connection**: Explore the `/forward` API endpoint with different channel/country combinations, understand the data structure, and replace dummy table data with a real API call for a single property
- [ ] **Enhanced Table with Benchmark Data**: Update the table to display meaningful benchmark information including percentile data from the API response
- [ ] **Multiple Properties Collection**: Add ability to fetch and display data for multiple properties in the table, handling async operations and potential errors
- [ ] **Filtering and Organization**: Implement filtering and sorting capabilities for property data (by emissions, channel, country, etc.) with appropriate UI controls
- [ ] **Property Comparison Feature**: Build a way for users to compare properties side-by-side, showing percent differences between property emissions with property selection and comparison view
- [ ] **Property Search**: Add a way for users to search for specific properties by domain; it should support small lists of domains.
